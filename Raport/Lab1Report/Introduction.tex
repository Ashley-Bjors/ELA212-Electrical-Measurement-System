\section{Introduction}
% What to add:
% 
% What are metal detectors and how do they work, write it more properly and with sources. Maybe do some about oscillator

A metal detector can be created using a direct current input that can be turned into an oscillating signal which can be ran 
through a coil inducing an electromagnetic field. This field will then induce a current in an adjacent coil,
which will be affected by any ferrous materials that enter the field since that will alter the inductance of the coils. Measuring the changes 
in the current of the second coil then allows for the detection of metals within the electromagnetic field.
