\section{Introduction}
% What to add:
% 
% What are metal detectors and how do they work, write it more properly and with sources. Maybe do some about oscillator

An oscilator sends a signal through a coil which induces an electromagnetic field. This field will then induce a current in an adjacent coil,
which will be affected by any ferrous materials that enter the field since that will alter it.
