The occilator:
A colpitts oscillator was chosen for its simplicity and since the needed components were available. A 10 mH inductor and two 
3.3 uF capacitors were used.

The Transformer:
Two coils were made of arbitrary number of turns and area. The resistor between the first coil and ground had a variable resistor to allow
 for as good of a signal as possible. The signal from the second coil was then amplified 10 times to make it stronger. 
 Lower resistor is better but a stable signal is needed. The signal is visible as either a phase shift as a change in the RMS.

The Likriktare:
A diode and a capacitor was used to make a "halvliktitare" which would allow for the signal to more easily be seen and for it to trigger
 sections like a light or a buzzer when triggered. This allows for the RMS to be seen more easily directly in the signal.
