While promising the results were weak and incosistent. The main factors contributing to this is believed to be bad connections between the 
coils of the transformer and the rest of the circuit which would be solved by soldering the wires to the coils. The signal could also be 
strengthened by increasing the number of turns of the coils, resulting in stronger inductance between them. 

A physical representation of the signal would be a beneficial addition once the circuit has been made more stable. For example some form of 
light or speaker could be attatched to the output which could allow for the metal detector to be used even without an oscilloscope to 
view the data.
