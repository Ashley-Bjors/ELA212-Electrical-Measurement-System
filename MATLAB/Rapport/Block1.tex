\section{SThreshold and color space}
\subsection{How did you create the filter? Did you get a good result, i.e. like the middle image of Figure 1? Why/why not? (Possibly there is a lot of white pixels â€“ do not worry).}
\subsection{Suggest how to improve the result.}
\subsection{How do you create the green filter in this color space? Which parameter was the most important?}
\subsection{How does your filtered image compare to the previous RGB-based result?}
\subsection{How did you do this?}
\subsection{Show the resulting image}
\section{Spatial operator and convolution}
\subsection{Do they produce the same result?}
\subsection{Which one is quicker and why? Use tic, toc. Note: As the image is small loop the operation to get a better time estimation}
\section{Calibration and measurement}
\subsection{What was the result of your 4 depth estimations? What do you conclude from these with respect to measurement and distortion?}
